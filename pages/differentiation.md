# Differentiation
There is a large number of Julia packages that provide differentiation functionality. The 3 main types of differentiation are symbolic, numerical, and automatic. Particularly automatic differentiation is a field in which there is a lot of research, and therefore a lot of new and experimental packages.

This section is not yet written. If you have used or developed Julia packages in this domain, we would love your help! Please visit the ["Contributing" section](https://github.com/JuliaPackageComparisons/JuliaPackageComparisons.github.io#contributing) of the [repository that hosts this website](https://github.com/JuliaPackageComparisons/JuliaPackageComparisons.github.io) for information on contributions.

For now, a good resource is [juliadiff.org](https://juliadiff.org/).
