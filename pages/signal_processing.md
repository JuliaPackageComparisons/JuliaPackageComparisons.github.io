# Signal Processing
## General packages
DSP.jl, SignalsBase.jl, SampledSignals.jl, SignalAnalysis.jl

## Specific domains
### Fourier Transformations
FFTW.jl

### Peak Finding
By "peak" we refer to a numerical value larger than any immediate neighbour. A simple example is a 
vector such as `[1, 2, 3, 1]`, which has a peak at it's third index. Functions also have peaks, but in a 
continuous context. Multidimensional arrays/functions also have peaks, which are significantly harder to find.  

Peaks.jl, FindPeaks.jl, Images.jl

### M/EEG
PyMNE.jl is a wrapper-toolbox around the popular mne-python M/EEG analysis toolbox

NeuroAnalyzer.jl is a non-registered, but feature strong package for the analysis of EEG data (https://neuroanalyzer.org/).

Unfold.jl is a toolbox to analyze event-based timeseries using regression with a focus on EEG (Electroencephalography) data. It is based on regression, and includes simulation related toolboxes like (UnfoldSim.jl), plotting (UnfoldMakie.jl). It supports deconvolution, hierarchical and non-linear (spline)-effects.
