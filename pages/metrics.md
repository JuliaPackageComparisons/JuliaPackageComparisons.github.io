# Metrics
A metric can refer to many things, but a fitting description (from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric)) goes as follows: 
> An adjective indicating relation to measurement in general, or a noun describing a specific type of measurement

In the world of programming languages, a typical use-case for metrics is for estimating performance of some algorithm. There are therefore many examples and implementations related to machine learning.

Below is a list of packages that implement metrics.

- [AdversarialPrediction.jl](https://github.com/rizalzaf/AdversarialPrediction.jl)
- [Avalon.jl](https://github.com/dfdx/Avalon.jl)
- [BetaML.jl](https://github.com/sylvaticus/BetaML.jl)
- [ClinicalTrialUtilities.jl](https://github.com/PharmCat/ClinicalTrialUtilities.jl)
- [Distances.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/Distances.jl)
- [FastAI.jl](https://github.com/FluxML/FastAI.jl/)
- [EvalMetrics.jl](https://github.com/VaclavMacha/EvalMetrics.jl)
- [KernelMethods.jl](https://github.com/sadit/KernelMethods.jl)
- [KnetMetrics.jl](https://github.com/KnetML/KnetMetrics.jl)
- [Lighthouse.jl](https://github.com/beacon-biosignals/Lighthouse.jl)
- [LossFunctions.jl](https://github.com/JuliaML/LossFunctions.jl)
- [Metrics.jl](https://github.com/zhmz90/Metrics.jl)
- [MLBase.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/MLBase.jl)
- [StatisticalMeasures.jl](https://github.com/JuliaAI/StatisticalMeasures.jl)
- [MLMetrics.jl](https://github.com/JuliaML/MLMetrics.jl)
- [MultivariateAnomalies.jl](https://github.com/milanflach/MultivariateAnomalies.jl)
- [PredictMD.jl](https://github.com/bcbi/PredictMD.jl)
- [ROCAnalysis.jl](https://github.com/davidavdav/ROCAnalysis.jl)
- [ROCCurves.jl](https://github.com/cossio/ROCCurves.jl)

If in doubt, a good bet is [StatisticalMeasures.jl](https://github.com/JuliaAI/StatisticalMeasures.jl). It is a new effort to provide a wide set of metrics in a consistent manner, born from the [JuliaAI](https://github.com/JuliaAI) ecosystem.
