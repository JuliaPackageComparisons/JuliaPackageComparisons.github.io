# Notebooks
Notebooks are a type of [Integrated Development Environment (IDE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment), and 
are particularly useful for sharing and showing computations.  

Relevant packages: [Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl), [IJulia.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl), [Neptune.jl](https://github.com/compleathorseplayer/Neptune.jl)

The author of Pluto.jl gave a talk ([YouTube link](https://youtu.be/Rg3r3gG4nQo?feature=shared)) at JupyterCon 2023, which is a good demonstration of how to use Pluto.jl.
