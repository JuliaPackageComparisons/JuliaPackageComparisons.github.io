# Web Apps
A web app is an interactive website. There are several Julia packages that help in the creation of web apps that run Julia as the backend language.

## Genie.jl

The most popular web app framework is [Genie.jl](https://github.com/GenieFramework/Genie.jl). As of September 2023 it has more than 2000 stars, making it one of the most starred Julia packages out there. It describes itself as follows:
> Genie is a full-stack web framework that provides a streamlined and efficient workflow for developing modern web applications. It builds on Julia's strengths (high-level, high-performance, dynamic, JIT compiled), exposing a rich API and a powerful toolset for productive web development.

## Oxygen.jl

Then there is https://github.com/ndortega/Oxygen.jl. It describes itself as
> A micro-framework built on top of the HTTP.jl library. Breathe easy knowing you can quickly spin up a web server with abstractions you're already familiar with.

## Bonito.jl

Finally, there is [Bonito.jl](https://github.com/SimonDanisch/Bonito.jl). It describes itself as follows:
> Easy way of building interactive applications from Julia. Uses Hyperscript to create HTML descriptions, and allows to execute Javascript & building of widgets. It also supports an offline mode, that exports your interactive app to a folder, and optionally records a statemap for all UI elements, so that a running Julia process isn't necessary anymore.

## Other
It is worth mentioning the github organization [JuliaWeb](https://github.com/JuliaWeb). JuliaWeb hosts a number of repositories which implement the tools needed to build web apps.
