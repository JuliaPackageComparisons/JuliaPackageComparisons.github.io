# Main Menu
Welcome to Julia Package Comparisons! This is a web resource created to help Julia users discover packages that might solve their problems, and to get guidance in choosing among similar packages. 

The button in the top left opens a menu of the different sections. Each section is related to some specific domain, for example plotting, and contains information about Julia packages within that domain. To return to this page, click "Julia Package Comparisons" at the top of the page.

#### Contributing
This website is currently a work in progress. The structure an functionality are shaping up, but there is still a lot of content missing. Once we are ready to present it, a release announcement will be made on [the Julia Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org/). For now, please take a look around to see if you like the project, and feel free to open issues and pull-requests in the github repository hosting this website (link in the top right) if you see something you can improve! If you just want to modify some existing content, see [this guide](https://github.com/JuliaPackageComparisons/JuliaPackageComparisons.github.io/blob/main/docs/contributing.md#modify-existing-content) in`contributing.md` for a brief description of how to do it. It is almost as easy as editing a text-file, and the maintainers will help you out if there are any problems ^_^

The goal is for the content of this website to be created by the users and contributors to the Julia packages being discussed.


<!-- First draft for the future content of "Contributing"

This website is created by the users and developers of packages. That includes you! If you see something misleading or wrong, or if you have something to add, please create an issue or pull request [here](https://github.com/JuliaPackageComparisons/JuliaPackageComparisons.github.io). In particular, see the "Contributing" section at the bottom of the README file.-->
