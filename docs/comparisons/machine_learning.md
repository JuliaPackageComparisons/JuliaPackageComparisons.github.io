# Machine Learning
This section is concerned with general machine learning packages. A separate section (link to section) exists for 
packages that only concern themselves with the sub-domain of Neural Networks.  
Relevant packages: [MLJ.jl](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJ.jl), [SciKitLearn.jl](https://github.com/cstjean/ScikitLearn.jl), [KNet.jl](https://github.com/denizyuret/Knet.jl), [HorseML.jl](https://github.com/MommaWatasu/HorseML.jl)

This section is not yet written. If you have used or developed Julia packages in this domain, we would love your help! Please visit the ["Contributing" section](https://github.com/JuliaPackageComparisons/JuliaPackageComparisons.github.io#contributing) of the [repository that hosts this website](https://github.com/JuliaPackageComparisons/JuliaPackageComparisons.github.io) for information on contributions.
