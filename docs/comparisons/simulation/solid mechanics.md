## Introduction

Finite element method (FEM) is widespreadly used in engineering to simulate linear or non-linear elastisity, plasticity, dynamic problems, sbtability or modal analysis problems. There are many Julia packages uses FEM, but these packages differs from the commercial finite element softwares (like Ansys or Abaqus).

### LowLevelFEM.jl

{{badge LowLevelFEM}}

Solve linear-elasticity finite element problems with fine-grained, low-level control over mesh, assembly, boundary conditions, and visualization. It uses engineering approach, no need to know what is the** ** *weak form* .
