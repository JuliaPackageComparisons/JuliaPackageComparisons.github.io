## Overview

Several packages collect physical constants.


## Packages

### PhysicalConstants.jl
{{badge PhysicalConstants}}

>Collection of fundamental physical constants with uncertainties. It supports arbitrary-precision constants.

[PhysicalConstants.jl](https://juliaphysics.github.io/PhysicalConstants.jl) was started in 2018 by [giordano](https://github.com/giordano). He is still the main contributor with a few commits by 6 other developers[^1].

### PeriodicTable.jl
{{badge PeriodicTable}}

>Periodic Table for Julians! ðŸ”¥ 

This is part of the [JuliaPhysics](https://github.com/JuliaPhysics) organization.
Use this i fyou just need standard data on elements: name, appearance, atomic_mass, boil, category, color, density, discovered_by, melt, molar_heat, named_by, number, period, phase, source, spectral_img, summary, symbol, xpos, ypos, shells.


[PeriodicTable.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPhysics/PeriodicTable.jl) was started in 2018 by [rahulkp220](https://github.com/rahulkp220). Since then, it has mainly been maintained by [carstenbauer](https://github.com/carstenbauer) with contributions from 9 others[^1].

### Mendeleev.jl
{{badge Mendeleev}}

>A Julia package for accessing chemical elements data. 

This contains (almost) all the same data as [PeriodicTable.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPhysics/PeriodicTable.jl) plus some more: <https://eben60.github.io/Mendeleev.jl/elements_data_fields/>. 
Use this if you need more data on the elements.

[Mendeleev.jl](https://github.com/Eben60/Mendeleev.jl) was started in 2022 by [Eben60](https://github.com/Eben60) who is also the top 3 contributor to [PeriodicTable.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPhysics/PeriodicTable.jl). It has only had few updates since 2022 and not by others[^1].
