# Intervals
There are several Julia packages for [interval sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)) and [interval arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_arithmetic).

## Overview
IntervalSets.jl and Intervals.jl are packages with the same purpose and integration has been considered but has not yet been realized.
Please check the following issue for more information.

* [IntervalSets.jl#67](https://github.com/JuliaMath/IntervalSets.jl/issues/67)
* [Intervals.jl#94](https://github.com/invenia/Intervals.jl/issues/94)

IntervalArithmetic.jl focuses on interval arithmetic.
There were issues to add an dependency on IntervalSets.jl, but this also has not yet been realized.

* [IntervalArithmetic#345](https://github.com/JuliaIntervals/IntervalArithmetic.jl/issues/345)
* [IntervalArithmetic#366](https://github.com/JuliaIntervals/IntervalArithmetic.jl/issues/366)
