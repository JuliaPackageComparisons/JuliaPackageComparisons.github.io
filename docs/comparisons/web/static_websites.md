## Introduction

## Overview
The most popular package for building static webpages with Julia is [Franklin.jl](#franklinjl), and for good reason. It is relatively easy to get started with, well documented, and battle-tested.

## Packages


### Franklin.jl
{{badge Franklin}}
Franklin is clearly the most popular alternative. Several websites related to Julia projects are built with Franklin, including this website and the [documentation](https://docs.makie.org/stable/) for [Makie.jl](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/).

### StaticWebPages.jl
{{badge StaticWebPages}}
StaticWebPages is less starred and less actively developed. It does however have a notable number of stars, indicating that it can get the job done. More detail can not be given by the current author, as I have not used the package myself.
