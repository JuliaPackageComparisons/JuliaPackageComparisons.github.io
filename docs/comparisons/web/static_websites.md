# Static Websites
The two main static web page packages for julia are [Franklin.jl](https://github.com/tlienart/Franklin.jl) and [StaticWebPages.jl](https://github.com/Humans-of-Julia/StaticWebPages.jl). Franklin is clearly the most popular, and as of September 2023 it is getting close to 900 stars. This makes it among the most starred julia packages. Several julia projects, including this website and the [documentation](https://docs.makie.org/stable/) for [Makie.jl](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/), are built with Franklin.

StaticWebPages is less starred and less actively developed. It does however have a notable number of stars, indicating that it can get the job done. More detail can not be given by the current author, as I have not used the package myself.
