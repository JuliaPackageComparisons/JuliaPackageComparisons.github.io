# About Testing
This is a meta-section for domains related to testing. This currently includes pages for:
- [Unit Testing](../unit_testing#unittesting)
- [Benchmarking code runtime](../runtime#runtime)
- [Profiling code](../profiling#profiling)
- [Property Based Testing (PBT)](../property_based_testing#propertybasedtesting).

It is currently intended for packages that test code or logic, which excludes e.g. testing the accuracy of a machine learning algorithm.
