# Property Based Testing
\toc

## Introduction
Programming and mathematics have always interested similar minds, and tackled related problems. Mathematics has strong formalism in place about the properties of certain objects (scalars, vectors, matrices) under certain operations (addition, multiplication, transposition), or even properties of the operators themselves. Property Based Testing (PBT) is an attempt to use computer programming to test if certain properties hold for certain objects.

## Overview
There are two main packages in this domain: [PropCheck.jl](https://github.com/Seelengrab/PropCheck.jl), and [Suppositon.jl](https://github.com/Seelengrab/Supposition.jl). I, the current sole author of this page, know little on this subject. However, the author of **both** packages has made a comparison page of the two packages in the [FAQ of the Supposition.jl docs](https://seelengrab.github.io/Supposition.jl/stable/faq.html). That content will hopefully be ported to this page by the package author in the future.
