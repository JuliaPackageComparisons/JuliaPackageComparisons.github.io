# Main Menu
Welcome to Julia Package Comparisons! This is a web resource created to help Julia users discover packages that might solve their problems, and to get guidance in choosing among similar packages. 

The button in the top left opens a menu of the different sections. Each section is related to some specific domain, for example plotting, and contains information about Julia packages within that domain.

#### Contributing
This website is currently a work in progress. Once it is "in shape", a proper release announcement will be made on [the Julia Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org/). For now, please take a look around to see if you like the project, and feel free to open issues and pull-requests in the [repository hosting this website](https://github.com/JuliaPackageComparisons/JuliaPackageComparisons.github.io) if you see something you can improve! The goal is for the content of this website to be created by the users and contributors to the Julia packages being discussed.


<!-- First draft for the future content of "Contributing"

This website is created by the users and developers of packages. That includes you! If you see something misleading or wrong, or if you have something to add, please create an issue or pull request [here](https://github.com/JuliaPackageComparisons/JuliaPackageComparisons.github.io).-->
